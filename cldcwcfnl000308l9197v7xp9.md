(part-1)  
In recent years, making web applications and APIs with Python has become increasingly popular. With the rise of microservices and serverless architectures, the need for fast and efficient web frameworks has never existed greater. One of the most promising frameworks to emerge in this space is FastAPI.

## What is FastAPI?

**FastAPI** is a *modern, fast (high-performance),* web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python-type hints. It is built on top of Starlette for high performance and includes support for OAuth2 authentication and built-in dependency injection.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance).
    
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. \*
    
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. \*
    
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr>Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
    
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
    
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
    
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
    

One of the key features of FastAPI is its use of type hints for request validation. This allows for automatic data conversion and input validation, making it easy to ensure that your API receives the correct data types. Additionally, FastAPI provides a simple and easy-to-use syntax that makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.

### Automatic docs

Interactive API documentation and exploration of web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default.

* [**Swagger UI**](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), with interactive exploration, calls and test your API directly from the browser.

### Growth Of fastAPI🚀

FastAPI also has a growing user base and a supportive community, with many helpful resources and third-party libraries available. This makes it easy to find solutions to common problems and add new functionality to your API.

Another great feature of FastAPI is its compatibility with Python's built-in Asyncio library. This allows you to easily create asynchronous endpoints, which can greatly improve the performance of your API.

FastAPI also allows easy integration with other popular libraries and frameworks, such as databases (e.g. SQLAlchemy, Tortoise-ORM), and front-end libraries (e.g. React, Vue.js). This makes it an excellent choice for building full-stack web applications.

#### Open Source 👩🏻‍💻

Finally, it's an open-source project, so you can use it for free, and you can also contribute to the development. This means that the framework is constantly evolving and improving.

### But Do I need a new flask?

Now people think when I have Falsk for micro-framework and Django (Full stack framework ),

FastAPI also has a more modern architecture than Flask and it's designed to be easy to use and understand, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. FastAPI also supports advanced features like dependency injection, OAuth2 authentication, and WebSocket support.

While Flask has a large and mature ecosystem and a lot of resources, libraries and tutorials available, FastAPI is a growing framework that has a lot of potential.

### Basic Guide

In This Blog we have Introduced FastAPI in the Next part we will make a small project about it.

In conclusion, FastAPI is a powerful and efficient framework for building APIs with Python. With its high performance, easy-to-use syntax, and wide range of features, it is quickly becoming a popular choice among developers. If you're looking to build a fast and efficient API, FastAPI is worth checking out.
